## üìÑ API Documentation

The **Postman Collection** for testing API requests is available in the repository.

üîπ Auto Import Token After Login

To automatically store and use the authentication token in Postman,
use the following script in the Tests or in the post-response Scripts(Windows App) tab of the login request:

```javascript

try {
    let json = pm.response.json();
    if (json.access_token) {
        pm.environment.set("TOKEN", json.access_token);
        console.log("Token saved successfully:", json.access_token);
    } else {
        console.log("Token not found in response:", json);
    }
} catch (error) {
    console.log("Error parsing JSON response:", error);
}
```

Go to environment variables and create a TOKEN Variable.

This script saves the access_token in the Videogames Environment as TOKEN. In every request that requires
authentication, use the following format for the Bearer Token:

```
Authorization: Bearer your_token_here
```
